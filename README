.Net Rules Engine written in C# and based on the Specification Pattern.

Goal of this project was to create a simple, powerful, and minimally intrusive way to plug business rules into your code.
The rules engine is basically a specialized container that provides a way to register IRule's and to locate them.
  
In a high level configuration module, you would register the rules: 

  RulesInitializer.RegisterRule<IAccountBalanceWithdrawlRules, decimal>(typeof(Account), () => new MinimumAccountBalanceToAllowWithdrawl(100));
  
  Here we are registering a MinimumAccountBalanceToAllowWithdrawl(which implements the IRule interface) rule scoped to a particuliar context, IAccountBalanceWithdrawlRules, and with a specification candidate type of Deciaml,
  and for the object type Account.
  
You can then inject the IRulesRunner into a class where you want to consume the rules:
	public Account(int id, IRulesRunner rulesRunner)
        {
            Id = id;
            this.rulesRunner = rulesRunner;           
        }

	public void WithDrawl(decimal amount)
        {
            rulesRunner.TestRules<IAccountBalanceWithdrawlRules, decimal, Account>(GetType(), amount, this);          
            Balance -= amount;
        }
		
		
The IRulesRunner executes all IRules registered for the context in which you are asking for rules(IAccountBalanceWithdrawlRules), 
and for the object in which you registed rules for(typeof(Account)), and returns void if all rules executed successfully,
or throws a InvalidOperationException if any rules failed.
